# Dosser App Blueprint

## Overview

Dosser is a modern, stylish, and fun note-taking application built with React and Firebase. It will feature a clean, intuitive user interface and demonstrate best practices in web development. The app's core feature is to automatically organize "Do's" (notes) into predefined "Doss" (categories) using AI.

## Project Outline

### Styling and Design

*   **UI Library:** Material-UI (MUI)
*   **Design:** Modern, with a focus on clean layouts, intuitive navigation, and a frictionless user experience.

### Features

*   **Routing:** Multi-page navigation using `react-router-dom`.
*   **Firebase Integration:** Do's are stored and retrieved from Firestore.
*   **Note Organization:**
    *   A navigation drawer provides access to different sections of the app.
    *   Do's are organized into "Doss" (user-defined categories).
    *   A dedicated "Doss" page lists all available categories.
    *   An "Others" category will hold Do's that don't fit a defined Doss.
    *   (Future) Gemini API integration for automatic categorization.
*   **Settings:** A dedicated page for managing application settings, including adding/editing Doss.

## Current Plan

1.  **Complete the rebranding of the application.**
2.  **Build the Settings Page:** Create the UI for adding and managing the list of "Doss."
3.  **Implement Gemini API:** Integrate Gemini to automatically categorize new Do's.
